# MyMetrics

MyMetrics helps you whenever the goal is to gather various daily DATA.

I often find myself focused on the rush, and not  finding time to answer some basic questions:
* How often have I eaten salty/meaty/sweety this week?
* How much did I sleep during the past days/week?
* So many questions regarding regular activities that tend to be squeezed out whenever the pace accelerate.

## Presentation

MyMetrics provide an API for gathering all the metrics. 
Made in REST, the API tries to be simple and efficient ðŸ˜„

### What is already done?

Well... nothing yet since the project is only starting.
But you can see the current milestone [here](https://github.com/ymougenel/mymetrics/milestone/1)

### What is planned?

For the moment mainly a stable API, with both correct tests and doc.
The advancement, as you can guess, depends on a lot of things.
You can however see the project progress through the [issues](https://github.com/ymougenel/mymetrics/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+)
 and [milestones](https://github.com/ymougenel/mymetrics/milestones).
## How to's (:warning: WIP)

### How to launch the application

**Get the app**

Downloading a runnable jar would be a marvelous feature; 
although [planned](https://github.com/ymougenel/mymetrics/issues/6), it is not available at the moment.

The easiest way is to either [download](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-github#download-zip)
 or [clone](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/clone-repo-cli) the project. 

**Run the app**

* With docker
//TODO
* With maven
//TODO

### How to use it

Since mymetrics goal is to provide an API, you can find a swagger documentation: http://_{Project_url}_/swagger-ui.html#/

For example for local development : [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/)
